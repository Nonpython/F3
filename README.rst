Project Introduction
********************

F3 is an abbreviation for Food and Farm Finder. It is a project of the 
`Whatcom Python Users Group`_ to create a Web based version of the 
Food and Farm Finder pamphlet available from `Sustainable Connections`_ as 
a `PDF`_.  The Python Web framework Django is being used. The original
inspiration for the project came from a `talk`_ given by Sean Boisen at 
LinuxFest 2010
